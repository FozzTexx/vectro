In here you will find the BASIC program for a drawing used on
http://reddit.com/r/RetroBattlestations. The program was intended to
be reusable and reasonably portable to many different BASIC
flavors. The graphics have been encoded in a vector format and are
scaled to the screen size. Routines for drawing lines and elliptical
arcs have been put into small subroutines.

=== Typing Tips ===
When typing the program in you can leave off any lines which contain
REM, they are not needed for the program to run. You can also leave
out all whitespace.

Note: On the TRS-80 Color Computer and BBC Micro you need to include
      the spaces around any IF, AND, OR, or THEN statement.
